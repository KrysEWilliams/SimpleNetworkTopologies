Welcome to SimpleNetworkTopologies's documentation!
===================================================

SimpleNetworkTopologies is software for the visualization of different network
topologies. It will be of use to anyone interested in learning more about network
topology! Please see the :ref:`user-guide` for information on how to use
SimpleNetworkTopologies, or the :ref:`developer-guide` for information on how to 
contribute!

The 6 topologies to explore include:
Generic- Generic Topologies are just basic setups of any number of nodes/ Computers that are connected in no specific way, and can be changed to accommodate different connections.

Star- Star Networking topologies consist of each separate computer/ node that separately connect to a central switch or hub. This is a common topology that allows for continued use, if for some reason one cable or connection fails. 

Bus- The Bus Networking topology is built using multiple nodes/ Computers connected to a switch or hub by a single connection cable.This is not too common due to its ability to run slower than normal, because of a high influx of connections all through one single cable.

FullyConnected- FullyConnected topologies are made of a group of nodes that are each connected to every other node/computer on the network. This allows for fast connections within  a network simultaneously. 

Ring- Ring Topologies are made of nodes that are connected by edges that pass around a token to receive connection. This is helpful when a Network needs to flow all in one direction.

Mesh- Mesh is helpful to attend to different needs of a network. Like a hybrid of Generic and Fully Connected topologies that can be used to enstate a network with mixed needs.
