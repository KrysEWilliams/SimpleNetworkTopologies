Welcome to SimpleNetworkTopologies's documentation!
===================================================

SimpleNetworkTopologies is software for the visualization of different network
topologies. It will be of use to anyone interested in learning more about network
topology! Please see the :ref:`user-guide` for information on how to use
SimpleNetworkTopologies, or the :ref:`developer-guide` for information on how to 
contribute!

How to Use :
1. Download the executable from this repository using the zip file.
2. Open the Zip file and allow the program to run.
3. Once the program is open, there are 6 example network topologies to learn about.
4. After learning about each basic topology, build your own network based on the prompt given to you. 
This executable software is a tool for users new to Networking topologies and setting them up correctly.
 This program is meant for users to learn the 6 basic network topologies, and what subnets are appropriate for each one.
 The 6 basic topologies include the Generic, Ring, Star, Bus, Mesh, and Fullyconnected layouts. 
 Learning how Networking topologies and subnets work is a great entry way into a feild like Cybersecurity or NetworkingAdministration,
  where having a secure and functioning network is of the upmost importance.

  This was an edit that made the release.
