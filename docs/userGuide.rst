Background
----------

SimpleNetworkingTopologies aims to aid in educating those who are interested in how a Network is set up. 
This is crucial for the fields or Cybersecurtiy or Network Management, because the secureness of a network 
can either help or endanger a company/government. As the world continues to become more dependent on cyberspace,
important information like debit/credit card information or social security numbers are all available to people with access. 
This is why netowrks are mandatory to only give information on a need- to- know basis.
