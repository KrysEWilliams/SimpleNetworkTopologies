This executable is for students or users new to Networking Topologies. This program will allow for users to see 6 examples of Networking Topologies that can be used to set up a network professionally. Using common layouts like Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, FullyConnected, and Generic Topologies, the program is a great guide for learning what topology will work best in different situations (i.e Corporate Offices or Computer Labs). Please see the [documentation](https://simplenetworktopologies.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more info!

## Installations
